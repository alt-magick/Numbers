The Truth About Math: Numbers as Symbolic Constructs

The fundamental nature of mathematics—its objectivity, certainty, and universality—forms the bedrock of modern logic. This essay documents an experiment that challenges this foundation, proposing that numbers are sophisticated **constructs of human cognition** and demonstrating how arithmetic and language can merge into a single, symbolic universe.

I. The Experiment: Unifying Language and Arithmetic

The core hypothesis is that English number-words can be assigned numeric values such that the sum of the letters in a word equals the value of the number itself. This transforms the problem into a solvable system of linear algebra equations.

Defining Equations

The word structure acts as a constrained system where each letter is a variable:

ONE -> O + N + E = 1

TWO -> T + W + O = 2

THREE -> T + H + R + E + E = 3

...

The Consistent Letter-to-Value Mapping

Solving the 10 equations (one through ten) for the 14 unique letters yields a single, internally consistent integer mapping, presented here from highest to lowest value:


T,10

I,7

V,6

U,5

R,4

S,3

N,2

O,1

G,0

E,-2

X,-4

F,-6

H,-7

W,-9

II. Verification and Arithmetic Functionality

This mapping establishes an internally consistent numeric entity within the English language, functioning perfectly across operations.

Core Verification (1 through 10)

The system is perfectly consistent, with every number-word summing exactly to its intended value:

* ONE: 1 + 2 + (-2) = 1
* TWO: 10 + (-9) + 1 = 2
* THREE: 10 + (-7) + 4 + (-2) + (-2) = 3
* EIGHT: -2 + 7 + 0 + (-7) + 10 = 8

Complex Arithmetic Tests

The words seamlessly integrate into standard arithmetic, demonstrating the system's structural integrity, particularly when scaling through powers of 10:

* Addition: one + two + three = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
* Subtraction: seven - four = 7 - 4 = 3
* Multiplication: three x two = 3 x 2 = 6
* Exponentiation: ten^two x three = (10^2) x 3 = 100 x 3 = 300
* Power of Ten: ten^one + ten^zero = 10^1 + 10^0 = 10 + 1 = 11
* Multi-Step: (one + four) x (three + two) - five = (5) x (5) - 5 = 20

III. Philosophical Implications: The Symbolic Multiverse

The successful construction of this system carries profound philosophical weight, challenging the assumed objectivity of mathematics:

1.  Numbers Are Not Absolute: The system's success, based on arbitrary but consistent rules, suggests numbers are frameworks of coherent relationships rather than fixed truths. This implies that mathematics is a language we collectively read and interpret.
2.  Unification of Systems: Language and mathematics are shown to be two dialects of the same symbolic universe. The identity three + five = eight aligns both linguistically and numerically.
3.  Gödel's Insight and Emergence: This system reinforces Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. The system's internal consistency depends on an external observer choosing and interpreting the mapping. Truth and arithmetic properties emerge from simple rules, requiring consciousness as the catalyst to detect and stabilize the universe. 

Conclusion

The letter-number system demonstrates that Truth, meaning, and understanding are relational, not absolute. They emerge dynamically from the interaction between symbols and the mind that perceives them, confirming consciousness's role as a co-creator of mathematical reality.
